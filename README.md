### Agile Methodology

This project was developed using **Agile methodologies** to facilitate flexibility and iterative progress. Embracing an adaptive planning process allowed me to continuously improve and respond to evolving project needs.

### User Stories and MOSCOW Prioritization

To outline project features, I defined user stories short descriptions from an end user's perspective. Employing the MOSCOW technique helped me prioritize these features effectively:

* **Must-Have:** Identified critical features essential for project success.
* **Should-Have:** Important features that were not immediately critical.
* **Could-Have:** Considered features that could be included if time allowed.
* **Wont-Have:** Acknowledged nice-to-haves that were intentionally excluded from the current scope.

MOSCOW prioritization guided me in managing expectations, focusing on key deliverables, and navigating the development process.

### Kanban Board for Task Management

I utilized a Kanban board to visually manage the flow of work throughout the project. The board's columns included:

* **To Do:** Tasks (user stories) planned for development.
* **In Progress:** Tasks actively being worked on.
* **Done** Tasks that have been finished.
* **Future Features:** Tasks that will be added in the future.
* **Wont Have** Tasks that wont be included in the project.

This Kanban board provided a clear visual representation of my project's progress, making it easier to track and manage tasks.

### Robots.txt

A robots.txt file has been generated. To streamline Google's crawling process, I've strategically blocked the profiles and bag app. This decision was made because these specific pages don't provide significant benefits for search engine indexing. By excluding them, I aim to optimize the crawling efficiency for the rest of the website.

### Sitemap.Xml

I've developed a sitemap.xml for the website to enhance its search engine visibility, particularly for platforms like Google. This file aids in the effective indexing of the site, making it easier for search engines to navigate and understand its structure.

### Facebook Business Page

### Closed bugs

| Bug | Solution |
| :---| :---|
| 500 server error on the profile | countryfield.js was in the CSS folder, I moved the file into the JS folder and the error was gone |
| When attempting to migrate the database using the standard python3 manage.py migrate command, I received a message stating that there are no migrations to apply. I had to use this command ```python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes --exclude checkout --exclude admin --exclude profiles > new.json``` | After inputting the command my database migrated. I spent quite a lot of time solving this bug as I thought the problem was with AWS and that is why I opted to use Cloudinary instead but after deploying my site I dont think I had any AWS problems at all it was the database preventing the deployment |

### Open Bugs

| Bug | Open/Closed |
| :---| :---|
| I encountered an issue with the placement of a background image on index.html. I had the background image within the body tag, but it wasn't positioned correctly on the page and I faced problems with the tint applied over the image. In an attempt to resolve this, I experimented with placing the background image around the entire page. However, I encountered issues with sizing—either the image was too large, too small, or not displaying at all. To address this, I decided to place the image within a ```<div>``` element with the class darken-img and the id bg-img. Surprisingly, the image was positioned perfectly with basic CSS styles. However, I noticed that the darken effect on the image had disappeared. To address this, I duplicated the ```<div class="darken-img" id="bg-img">``` and placed it underneath the original one. Strangely, if I removed the bg-img from the class, either the darken effect or the background image would vanish. As a temporary solution, I left the class declared twice to maintain the desired appearance. | Open |
| In the Nav bar the link for Cables & Adapters loads and empty page I was unable to find the correct url for the webpage I think its the "&" which is causing this problem. | Open |
| When you click edit on a product a toast pops up telling you that "You updated (Product)" this toast should say you are editing (product) | Open |
| I have noticed sometimes when I login on mobile I get a 403 error but once I hit back I am brought to the home page and I am logged in I have displayed a screenshot below | Open
